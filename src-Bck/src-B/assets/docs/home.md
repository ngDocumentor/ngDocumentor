## { ngDocumentor }


A simple site to serve .md files; and which gets you up and running in less than 10 minutes. 
Pass brand name, top navigation, sidebar menus, and footer navigation links using .json configuration files.

* Works just with easy to configure json config files for top, sidebar, and footer navigation to configure your documentation site.
* Works well for any documentation site documented using .md files.
* Supports HTML pages only hosts like Github pages where URL rewrites are unavailable due to security reasons.
* Can have Service Workers enabled for basic offline viewing support. You will have to use the [development repository](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor) to create a custom build to achieve this. The service worker configuration with file assets of your site will be needed.
* Simple lunr based search in a non-blocking and performant way from web workers. Works offline if service workers are enabled using your custom build!
* Edit the [ngDocumentor Angular source](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor), if you need to extend or theme this site as per your need.
* Build's / Distribution's usage Documentation available in this site.
* Demo site - You are using it!
