### { ngDocumentor }
  
A simple site to serve .md files; and which gets you up and running in less than 10 minutes. 
Pass brand name, top navigation menus, and sidebar navigation links using .json configuration files.

* Works well for any documentation site documented using .md files. Also supports HTML pages only hosts like Github pages where URL rewrites are unavailable due to security reasons.
* Edit the [ngDocumentor Angular source](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor), if you need to extend or theme it as per your need.
* Has Angular Service Workers enabled (basic PWA support). You will have to use the [developement repository](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor) to achieve that. Disabled by default (service worker config file generation needed).
* Usage Documentation available in this site.
* Demo site - You are using it!
