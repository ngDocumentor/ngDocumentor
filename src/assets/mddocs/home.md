## { ngDocumentor }


A simple site to serve .md files; and which gets you up and running in less than 10 minutes. 
Pass brand name, top navigation, sidebar menus, and footer navigation links using .json configuration files.

* Works well for any documentation site documented using .md files. Also supports HTML pages only hosts like Github pages where URL rewrites are unavailable due to security reasons.
* Edit the [ngDocumentor Angular source](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor), if you need to extend or theme it as per your need.
* Has Angular Service Workers enabled (basic offline viewing support). You will have to use the [development repository](https://github.com/ngDocumentor/ngDocumentor) to build and achieve that. The service worker configuration file for assets of your site is needed.
* Usage Documentation available in this site.
* Demo site - You are using it!
